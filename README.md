# No-Limit-Texas-Hold-em-Poker-Application
We are seeking an experienced Python developer to develop a No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker application that enables human players to compete against AI opponents. The AI opponents should exhibit strategies consistent with skilled players who approach game-theoretic optimal (GTO) play. This application will be used as a research tool to study the neural basis of decision-making in poker and how it is influenced by a player's cognitive and emotional state.

Key Features & Requirements:

AI Opponents
- Support for a variable number of human players.
- Support for a variable number of AI opponents.
- AI strategies should be adjustable in skill level, ranging from basic strategic play to near-GTO decision-making.
- AI decision logic should incorporate bet sizing, bluffing, and adjustments based on player tendencies.

Game Mechanics
- Full implementation of No-Limit Texas Hold'em rules.
- Configurable blinds, stack sizes, and game speed.
- Ability to generate and introduce tilt-inducing events, such as “bad beats” and “coolers”.

Data Logging & Analysis
- Detailed hand histories, including time-stamped decision points for all players.
- Quantitative evaluation of player decisions based on Expected Value (EV) relative to counterfactual actions.
- Ability to export game data in structured formats (e.g., JSON, CSV) for further analysis.

User Interface
- Lightweight graphical user interface.
- Options to replay hands and review decision-making metrics.

Performance & Extensibility
- Efficient simulation of poker hands and AI decisions.
- Modular design to allow future extensions (e.g., integration with physiological recording devices).

Preferred Skills & Experience:
- Proficiency in Python, including experience with game development, AI, or poker bots.
- Strong understanding of poker strategy, game theory, and GTO principles.
- Experience with Monte Carlo simulations, reinforcement learning, or other AI techniques for poker decision-making.
- Familiarity with data logging and structured output formats.

If you have experience in poker AI development and are excited about building a tool for scientific research, we'd love to hear from you! Please provide relevant project samples or a brief description of how you would approach this task in your application.
----------
To create a No-Limit Texas Hold'em Poker Application where human players can compete against AI opponents with strategies ranging from basic to game-theoretic optimal (GTO) play, there are several components to cover:

    Poker Game Mechanics: This includes the rules of No-Limit Texas Hold'em, handling blinds, stack sizes, player actions, and the community cards.
    AI Opponents: Implement AI with various skill levels, from basic strategies to near-optimal GTO-based strategies. The AI should be able to adjust to different player tendencies and incorporate complex poker strategies, including bluffing and bet sizing.
    Data Logging & Analysis: Log hand histories, decisions, and expected value calculations for analysis.
    User Interface: Create a simple interface that displays the game state, allows players to make decisions, and enables the review of hands.

Below is an outline of how the code could look using Python for developing the poker game with AI opponents and some simple AI logic. For this purpose, the game’s AI will be kept simple and will use a random decision-making strategy for bluffing, bet sizing, and other moves to be adjustable later.
Libraries Required

    random – For random decision-making and bluffing.
    numpy – For some computational logic.
    pygame (optional) – For the graphical interface.
    pandas/json – For data logging and exporting hand history.

You can install required libraries with:

pip install pygame numpy pandas

Key Features of the Code:

    Game Mechanics:
        The class PokerGame simulates the rounds of a poker game.
        The game alternates between human and AI players making decisions.
        AI decisions are random for now but can later be enhanced with more sophisticated strategies like GTO-based decision-making.

    AI Opponents:
        The ai_decision function is a placeholder for a random strategy. You can enhance this by integrating Monte Carlo simulations, reinforcement learning, or a pre-trained neural network for strategy development.

    Data Logging & Analysis:
        Hand history is logged to a JSON file with details such as the players’ hands, actions, stacks, and the pot.
        A CSV version of the hand history is also exported for further analysis.

    User Interface:
        There is no graphical user interface (GUI) in this version; it works via the terminal/console. You can enhance this using pygame or other GUI libraries.
        Players are prompted for their actions in each round.

Next Steps for Improvement:

    AI Decision Logic: The AI logic can be enhanced by integrating more advanced strategies like Monte Carlo simulations, GTO solvers, or machine learning models.
    Graphical User Interface: Implement a GUI for better visual interaction using libraries like pygame or tkinter.
    Tilt Events: Create events that introduce random elements like "bad beats" to simulate tilt or emotional reactions.
    Advanced Data Logging: Include more detailed logs, such as bet sizes, hand strength evaluations, and player tendencies over time.

This code sets up the basic structure of a No-Limit Texas Hold'em poker application with AI opponents and logging, providing a foundation for further enhancements tailored to your research needs.
